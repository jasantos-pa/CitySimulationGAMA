The growth of the car fleet has intensified urban problems, especially in dormitory cities, where daily routines depend heavily on commuting to a nearby metropolis. In this study, we develop an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate mobility patterns in Leganés, a dormitory city in the metropolitan area of Madrid, Spain. The model is built using the GAMA platform and incorporates data from the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, OpenStreetMap, the Comunidad de Madrid and the Ayuntamiento de Leganés. The simulation captures residents' journeys across road, pedestrian and rail networks, with the aim of realistically representing travel behaviour and mode choice. In this paper, we review the state of the art, identifying the absence of GAMA and simulators focused on individual agents. Previous work with this platform is analysed and strategies to increase the number of agents are proposed. An urban simulation environment is implemented as an extensible base on which the research community can build new scenarios.
